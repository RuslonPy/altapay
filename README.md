Hi there!
There are solutions for the both taska given by Altapay.

The class Task1 for the first task and the above ones for the second.

!Warning: In application.properties config file, 
'spring.sql.init.mode=always' has to be changed to 'spring.sql.init.mode=never'.
Default values are initialized in the first running the project and in the next ones it tries to reinitialize the same defaults
and in turn it gives issues kinda retries to save duplication values on db.
